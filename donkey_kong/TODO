Unimplemented stuff
-------------------
Smarter barrel movement strategy
	- Barrels look at joystick direction & Mario's state
	- Tend to "run away" from active hammers

Blue barrels

Moving ladders
	- State init
	- Update
	- Patches to Mario's ladder state handler

Firebarrel
	- initial drawing
	- flame animation

DLI in Elevator rack to hack PL3 <- PL1 (so fireballs don't look bad.)

Punt PAL totally

Punt barrel inviso-state

Put yellow in fireball fonts


Bug fixes
---------
Mario
	- sticks on ladders sometimes
	- Bogus jumpover on edges of screen
	- install new, non-transparent fonts

Collision detect loses when Mario doesn't touch the edge of an
	object's kill area.

Barrels go down adjacent to ladders

Floating scores get messed-up on top of ladders (so move 'em.)
Sequential floating-scores lose.

VDRAW doesn't clip very well to the left (garbage created in middle of
	the screen.)

Wierd things with Luser-abort.  Punt ABORTP() during cartoon sequences
	(only active during game play.)

Fireball leap doesn't look very good (and probably should be punted.)

Move 2nd hammer to the left on the Ramps rack.

Need better lettering on HOWHI screen, also "PLAYER 1/2" indicator.

Kong currently creates too many barrels (/really/ slowing down the
	animation on the Ramps rack.)

Kong is garbaged-up on the Elevators rack.

Not all spring fonts are being shown (so punt a couple of them.)
